urx is a python library to control the robots from [Universal Robots](https://www.universal-robots.com/). It is published under the LGPL license and comes with absolutely no guarantee.

It is meant as an easy to use module for pick and place operations, although it has been used for welding and other sensor based applications that do not require high control frequency.

Both the 'secondary port' interface and the real-time/matlab interface of the UR controller are used. urx can optionally use the [python-math3d](https://github.com/mortlind/pymath3d)(GPL) library to receive and send transformation matrices to the robot urx is known to work with all release robots from Universal Robot.

urx was primarily developed by [Olivier Roulet-Dubonnet](https://github.com/oroulet) for [Sintef Raufoss Manufacturing](http://www.sintef.no/manufacturing/).



# Install

The easiest is probably to use pip:
```
pip install urx
```


# Example use:

```python
import urx

rob = urx.Robot("192.168.0.100")
rob.set_tcp((0, 0, 0.1, 0, 0, 0))
rob.set_payload(2, (0, 0, 0.1))
sleep(0.2)  #leave some time to robot to process the setup commands
rob.movej((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), a, v)
rob.movel((x, y, z, rx, ry, rz), a, v)
print "Current tool pose is: ",  rob.getl()
rob.movel((0.1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), a, v, relative=true)  # move relative to current pose
rob.translate((0.1, 0, 0), a, v)  #move tool and keep orientation
rob.stopj(a)

rob.movel(x, y, z, rx, ry, rz), wait=False)
while True :
    sleep(0.1)  #sleep first since the robot may not have processed the command yet
    if rob.is_program_running():
        break

rob.movel(x, y, z, rx, ry, rz), wait=False)
while rob.getForce() < 50:
    sleep(0.01)
    if not rob.is_program_running():
        break
rob.stopl()

try:
    rob.movel((0,0,0.1,0,0,0), relative=True)
except RobotError, ex:
    print("Robot could not execute move (emergency stop for example), do something", ex)
```

# Development using Transform objects from math3d library:

```python
from urx import Robot
import math3d as m3d

robot = Robot("192.168.1.1")
mytcp = m3d.Transform()  # create a matrix for our tool tcp
mytcp.pos.z = 0.18
mytcp.orient.rotate_zb(pi/3)
robot.set_tcp(mytcp)
time.sleep(0.2)

# get current pose, transform it and move robot to new pose
trans = robot.get_pose()  # get current transformation matrix (tool to base)
trans.pos.z += 0.3
trans.orient.rotate_yb(pi/2)
robot.set_pose(trans, acc=0.5, vel=0.2)  # apply the new pose


#or only work with orientation part
o = robot.get_orientation()
o.rotate_yb(pi)
robot.set_orientation(o)
```

# Other interactive methods/properties

```python

from urx import Robot
rob = Robot("192.168.1.1")
rob.x  # returns current x
rob.rx  # returns 0 (could return x component of axis vector, but it is not very usefull
rob.rx -= 0.1  # rotate tool around X axis
rob.z_t += 0.01  # move robot in tool z axis for +1cm

csys = rob.new_csys_from_xpy() #  generate a new csys from 3 points: X, origin, Y
rob.set_csys(csys)
```


# Robotiq Gripper

urx can also control a Robotiq gripper attached to the UR robot.  The robotiq class was primarily developed by [Mark Silliman](https://github.com/markwsilliman).

## Example use:

```python
import sys
import urx
from urx.robotiq_two_finger_gripper import Robotiq_Two_Finger_Gripper

if __name__ == '__main__':
	rob = urx.Robot("192.168.0.100")
	robotiqgrip = Robotiq_Two_Finger_Gripper()

	if(len(sys.argv) != 2):
		print "false"
		sys.exit()

	if(sys.argv[1] == "close") :
		robotiqgrip.close_gripper()
	if(sys.argv[1] == "open") :
		robotiqgrip.open_gripper()

	rob.send_program(robotiqgrip.ret_program_to_run())

	rob.close()
	print "true"
	sys.exit()
```
